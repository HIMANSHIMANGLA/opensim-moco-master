Moco is a part of %OpenSim for solving optimal control problems for
musculoskeletal systems defined as %OpenSim models.
The package has Python, MATLAB, and XML (command-line) interfaces; the core
library is written in C++.

Here are some problems you can solve with Moco:

- Solve for the muscle activity that tracks a known motion.
- Solve for a new motion that optimizes some cost (e.g., effort).
- Solve for mass properties that minimize residual (unrealistic) forces.

@defgroup mocogoal Available goals

These are the available goals you can use in your cost functional or as endpoint
constraints. If none of these satisfy your needs, you can define your own using
a plugin.


@defgroup mocomodelutil Model and trajectory utilities

These are utilities for visualizing model, editing a
MocoTrajectory, and more.
To use these utilities in MATLAB, prepend the function
names with "opensimMoco."; for example, `opensimMoco.visualize()` or
`org.opensim.modeling.opensimMoco.visualize()`.
In Python, use `opensim.visualize()`.

@defgroup moconumutil Numeric and data utilities

Interpolate or resample data, and read/write tables.
To use these utilities in MATLAB, prepend the function
names with "opensimMoco."; for example, `opensimMoco.interpolate()` or
`org.opensim.modeling.opensimMoco.interpolate()`.
In Python, use `opensim.interpolate()`.

@defgroup mocologutil String and logging utilities

Easily format and log messages; intended for internal use by Moco.

@defgroup mocogenutil Generic utilities

Utilities for parallelism, strings, date/time, and error-checking.
