@section obtaining Obtaining Moco

Download Moco for Windows or Mac from https://simtk.org/projects/opensim-moco.
The Moco distribution contains a MATLAB/Java package, a Python package, a C++
library, and a command-line tool. Currently, Moco does not have a graphical user
interface.

The distribution is a ZIP file that you can place anywhere on your computer;
for example, `C:/Users/<username>/opensim-moco-<version>` on Windows
or `/Users/<username>/opensim-moco-<version>` on Mac.
We refer to this location

@note On Windows, set your Windows PATH environment variable to include
`<OpenSim-Moco-Install>/bin` before any other OpenSim/OpenSense paths.

Decide which of Moco's interfaces you want to use and follow the relevant
instructions below.

@section buildingfromsource Building Moco from source

If you want to edit Moco's C++ code or use Moco on a platform for which we do
not distribute binaries (e.g., Linux), then you must build Moco from source.
Developing your own cost module does not require building Moco from source.

For instructions, visit the source code repository at
https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-moco and consult the README.md file.

@section usingmatlab Using Moco in MATLAB

Start Matlab, change your current directory to
`<OpenSim-Moco-Install>/Resources/Code/Matlab` and run `configureMoco.m`.

Restart Matlab and test that Matlab is properly configured to use Moco by
running:

```
>> org.opensim.modeling.opensimMoco.GetMocoVersionAndDate();
```

Make sure the output is consistent with the version of Moco you intend to use.

The Moco distribution contains Matlab examples in the folder
`Resources/Code/Matlab`. Start with `exampleSlidingMass.m`.

@section usingpython Using Moco in Python

To use the Python package that comes with the Moco distribution, you must use
the same Python distribution with which Moco was built. For Windows, this is the
Python 3 distribution from python.org. For Mac, this is the Python 3
package from Homebrew.

The Moco distribution contains Python examples in the folder
`Resources/Code/Python`. Start with `exampleSlidingMass.py`.

If you would prefer to use Python 2 instead of Python 3, let us know.

In the future, we hope to make the Python package easier to install by
distributing it through the Conda package manager.

@section usingxml Using Moco with XML files and the command line

Moco provides a command-line tool, `bin/opensim-moco`, through which you can
solve studies saved as XML files, using the `.omoco` file extension.

The command-line interface allows generating a template XML `.omoco` file and
for visualizing a solution.

Unfortunately, Moco does not yet provide any examples of XML files for use with
the command-line interface. However, the MATLAB/Python examples can generate XML
files that you can then use through the command-line interface.

@section usingcpp Using Moco in C++

This section is under development.

<!--
TODO: examples are designed so that you can run them without any special
settings.

TODO: unify documentation for executables and plugins in C++ because they
share background about compilers.

TODO use through CMake. Use the same compiler or newer. Use C++11.
