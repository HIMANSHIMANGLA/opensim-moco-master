/// The top-level class for solving a custom optimal control problem.
///
/// This class consists of a MocoProblem, which describes the optimal control
/// problem, and a MocoSolver, which describes the numerical method for
/// solving the problem.
///
/// Workflow
/// --------
/// When building a MocoStudy programmatically (e.g., in C++), the workflow is
/// as follows:
///
/// 1. Build the MocoProblem (set the model, constraints, etc.).
/// 2. Call MocoStudy::initSolver(), which returns a reference to the
/// MocoSolver.
///    After this, you cannot edit the MocoProblem.
/// 3. Edit the settings of the MocoSolver (returned by initSolver()).
/// 4. Call MocoStudy::solve(). This returns the MocoSolution.
/// 5. (Optional) Postprocess the solution, perhaps using
/// MocoStudy::visualize().
///
/// After calling solve(), you can edit the MocoProblem and/or the MocoSolver.
/// You can then call solve() again, if you wish.
///
/// Saving the study setup to a file
/// --------------------------------
/// You can save the MocoStudy to a file by calling MocoStudy::print(), and you
/// can load the setup using MocoStudy(const std::string& omocoFile).
/// MocoStudy setup files have a `.omoco` extension.
///
/// Solver
/// ------
/// The default solver uses the **tropter** direct
/// collocation library. We also provide the **CasADi** solver, which
/// depends on the **CasADi** automatic differentiation and optimization
/// library. If you want to use CasADi programmatically, call initCasADiSolver()
/// before solve(). We would like to support users plugging in their own
/// solvers, but there is no timeline for this. If you require additional
/// features or enhancements to the solver, please consider contributing to
/// **tropter**.
